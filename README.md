# Quick Lorem Ipsum

## What is this?

It is a Google Chrome extension.

## Why is this?

Get 'Lorem Ipsum' single paragraph instantly!

## But how?

Working on browser applications, I've found that filling out forms with text can sometimes be very boring (especially if the input field has a minimum text length limit).

Obviously there are extensions (and they are really helpful) where you can choose the paragraph size, number of paragraphs, etc.
But now I needed any paragraph of text and the ability to quickly get it.
So I decided to add a small extension that allows you to click on an icon and get one paragraph of 'Lorem Ipsum' template text.

Thus, in one click + pressing CMD/Ctrl+V you can fill the input field with text.
